My name is Vladislav, I am from Ukraine. Tech nerd, green tea lover, huge fan of a
bicycle riding, like to take random photos, and in the end, just a human.

## What do I do for the living?
Currently, I am working as a full-time Software
Developer, mainly focusing on desktop software development in Rust/C/C++.

While I am developing relatively high-level software for the living, I am also very obsessed
with the development of low-level stuff and in my spare time I am slowly progressing
in my hardware development skills and embedded software development.
